  <br><p><b>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</b> represents the modern practices of provision, configuring and managing an IT infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files rather than deploying physical hardware and systems. As such, data centers define traditional IT components such as servers, virtual machines, load balancers, databases, network topology and other related systems as their software equivalent.</p>

  <h2>Business Brief</h2>

  <p>Infrastructure as Code represents the point where both automation and virtualization come together. Based on the practices of software development, it emphasizes consistent, repeatable routines for provisioning and changing systems and their configuration.</p>

  <p class="highlighted mw-collapsible-content">IaC evolved to solve this problem in the release pipeline where files are changed under source control. The IaC concept is like programming scripts, which are used to automate IT processes. However, scripts are primarily used to automate a series of static steps that must be repeated numerous times across multiple servers.<ref>Cardinal, G. (2017, January 24). GCFM Planning, budgeting and forecasting Prototype.<i> [http://ppx.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GCFM-Solution-BPC-PPX-Jan-2017.pdf Cardinal, G.].</i> Retrieved from ppx.ca</ref> IaC uses higher-level or descriptive language to code more versatile and adaptive provisioning and deployment processes.<ref>Chan, M. (2018, April 3). 15 Infrastructure as Code tools you can use to automate your deployments.<i> [https://www.thorntech.com/2018/04/15-infrastructure-as-code-tools/ Chan, M.].</i> Retrieved from thorntech.com</ref></p>


  <p class="highlighted mw-collapsible-content">The wide adoption of virtualization, self-service cloud infrastructure and, particularly, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), institutions had to automate their whole infrastructure deployment process in a repeatable and consistent manner to eliminate human error. This principle of Infrastructure as Code is called idempotence where a deployment using a specific configuration will always generate the same results regardless of the environment.</p><p>The benefits of using Infrastructure as Code over the manual approach are :</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Speed:</b> IaC makes the software development lifecycle more efficient by allowing you to quickly set up a complete infrastructure just by running a script.</li>
  
    <li><b>Consistency:</b> Many mistakes occur when using the manual process because humans are fallible. IaC solves that problem by having the configuration files themselves be the source of truth and to avoid any discrepancies.</li>
  
    <li><b>Cost:</b> By employing cloud computing along with IaC, the cost of infrastructure management is dramatically reduced. Money spent on hardware, operators, physical space to store the systems all add up but with IaC, automation strategies frees engineering from performing manual, slow and error-prone tasks to focus on what matters the most.</li>

  <p>Another emerging industry trend related to Cloud Workspace is Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).<ref>Wikipedia.org (2020, January 2). Bring your own device.<i> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device Wikipedia.org].</i> Retrieved from en.wikipedia.org</ref> Computing device affordability has increased in recent years, with many employees already possessing one or more personal devices capable of performing their work duties. There are different potential financial benefits to the employer when adopting this concept, and some studies indicate that employee productivity can increase.</p>

  <h3>Challenges</h3>

<p>Switching<ref>Citrix <i> [https Citrix].</i> Retrieved from Citrix</ref>adopters</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Adoption of the new skills</b> personnel needs to build experience in consuming and operating technology as a service.</li>

  <li><b>Changing internal corporate process</b> such as company billing systems.</li>

  <li><b>Introduction of a more agile approach</b> to adopt and use cloud services.</li>

  <li><b>Transforming  corporate culture to become more “cloud compliant,”</b> ensuring employee buy-in.</li>      
</ul>
  
  <p class="inline"> Cloud Workspace poses other significant organizational challenges. Although it offers greater flexibility for the communication and work with clients, external stakeholders and citizens, uptake of the technology can severe connections between employees within the organization making communication and workflow less effective. With the ability of anytime, anywhere and any device usage, Cloud Workspace is also a potential security nightmare, owing its effectiveness to the security of local wifi networks and devices often outside of organizational control. There is also the potential, as employer increasingly rely on employee-owned devices, for employees to be burdened by the cost of such devices and their security.</p>
  <p class="inline-spacer"></p>
  <p class="inline">Additionally, SaaS platforms such as Office 365, are constantly being updated by the vendors. These updates often occur at a faster rate than the IT organization can react and ensure changes are appropriate for the network. While users generally benefit from rapid updates, infrastructure and operation team leaders find it challenging to support their users, appropriately test, and can’t control whether to accept the changes.</p>

  <h4>Considerations</h4>

  <p>The Cloud Workspace is a concept that has the power to shift employee workspace, work habits, and work culture in a new direction. This concept also promises major financial and work effort benefits to the employer. Cloud computing is no longer a question of if or when – it is here to stay and will continue to grow. Cloud Workspace as a cloud computing offering is now in the on-boarding phase.</p>

  <p>While remote access to work tools and the work environment by employees won travel status or working off-site is already available, the Government of Canada is increasingly adopting working from home as a valid option for its employees.  Enabling employees to access and use the same workspace, no matter where they are located and potentially no matter what device they use, may produce major benefits and efficiencies for both employees and the organization.</p>

  <p>While this concept comes with new opportunities, it also brings new constraints, challenges, security and privacy questions that need to be considered carefully prior to full adoption by the Government of Canada. A successful digital workplace program must align with digital transformational goals, requiring thoughtful establishment of effective governance practices of the new applications and the data they create. Moreover, it must be responsive to the employee experience, as any digital transformation will ultimately fail without a willing, informed, well-equipped and engaged workforce.<ref>CIO (August 11, 2016) .The Top Challenges Of Cloud Adoption And Optimization You Must Plan For. <i> [https://www.cio.com/article/3106771/the-top-challenges-of-cloud-adoption-and-optimization-you-must-plan-for.html CIO].</i> Retrieved from CIO</ref></p>

  <p>SSC leaders responsible for transforming IT operations to support digital workplace applications should consider creating a SaaS digital workspace applications product team focused on SaaS applications, such as Office 365 or G Suite to build expertise in-house. Additionally, SSC should consider staffing the digital workplace SaaS applications support team with a combination of technical and nontechnical personnel, as changes in how employees work (traditional to digital) will need to be managed via communications and formal change management processes targeting employee work and culture behaviour.</p>

  <p>SSC will need to consider the priorities and foundational aspect of Office 365 for architectural coherence. While Office 365 will become a foundational core element of digital workplace, SSC will need to remain agile and flexible enough to deploy situational deployments to address certain business requirements. SaaS and digital workplace applications (e.g., Office 365 and G Suite), in particular, force IT infrastructure and operations leaders to transform the way they manage IT infrastructure, implement changes, handle incidents, support users, and provision training. This is because the SaaS vendor controls the changes made to the SaaS application and the rate at which they are made. The dynamic nature of the SaaS environment means the organization must have an agile approach to supporting SaaS applications. Bolstering SSC’s change management processes and staff understanding of change principles is advised for critical success in deploying cloud workplace.</p>

  <p>Lastly, SSC will need to consider how it handles remote work and telework options for its employees. As the office tools become more accessible away from the main headquarters, SSC will need to undergo a culture shift in accepting employees who wish to work from a wide variety of locations. Trust will need to increase in SSC employees and managing by performance and output is essential for success. In parallel, some employees will require training on how to use distributed-type technology such as video-teleconferencing, collaboration tools, instant messaging etc. A clear and visible senior executive will be required to lead this change for cultural shift to occur in SSC and embrace Cloud Workplace and digital working.</p>
