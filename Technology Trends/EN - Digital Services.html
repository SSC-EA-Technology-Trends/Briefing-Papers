  <h2 class="expand mw-collapsible-content">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">Digital Service(s) and Digital Government do not mean the same thing; however, since both have common themes, government organizations often place them together. As a result, Digital Services and Digital Government may be conflated or mistakenly used interchangeably within a public government organization.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">There is no agreed upon industry or public definition for Digital Services. However, common Digital Services meanings refer to the electronic delivery of information including data and content across multiple platforms and devices like web or mobile that is entirely automated, or involves very little human intervention.  Where the service delivery is controlled by the service’s customers and is only utilising the online channel for both customer and back-end business processes.  For example, as an application for a mobile phone or tablet computer.  Information is presented in a way that is easy to use and understand and typically involves transactional services such as submitting forms for processing and receiving benefits (passport renewals, driver license renewals, immigration forms, parking tickets, hotel room reservations, etc.).</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">Whereas, Digital Government, sometimes referred to as e-Government, can be defined as “the use of digital technologies, as an integrated part of governments’ modernization strategies, to create public value. It relies on digital government ecosystem comprised of government actors, non-governmental organizations, businesses, citizens’ associations and individuals which support the production of an access to data, services and content through interaction with government. Additionally, terms such as E-Services and E-Business, are also conflated with digital services. E-Services/E-Business are simply umbrella terms for services on the Internet.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">There are three main components of a Digital Service: the Service Provider, the Service Receiver, and the channels of Service Delivery. Concerning a public or government Digital Service/E-Service, the Public Agency is the Service Provider, the citizens and businesses are the Service Receivers, and the Public Agency’s application or IT platform is the channel of Service Delivery and the Internet is the primary mechanism for the channel. There is a wide technical categorization of Digital Services that outlines the degree to which a service is actually digital, including: a Non-Digital Service, a Digital Service, a Fully Digitalized Service, a Managed Digital Service, and an Optimized Digitalized Service.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">The International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasts that worldwide spending on technologies and services that enable Digital Transformation will reach $1.97 trillion in 2022, per the IDC Worldwide Semiannual Digital Transformation Spending Guide. IDC predicts that digital transformation spending will grow steadily, achieving a five-year CAGR of 16.7 percent between 2017 and 2022.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">The nominal gross domestic product (GDP) associated with digital economic activities in Canada totalled $109.7 billion in 2017 or 5.5% of the total economy. While the digital economy is not an industry, to give a scale of its importance, in 2015 it was larger than mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction (4.8%), transportation and warehousing (4.6%) and utilities (2.4%).  In Canada, between 2010 and 2017, nominal GDP for the digital economy (+40.2%) grew more than the total economy (+28%). On an annual basis, the digital economy increased more than the total economy every year except 2011 and 2017, which were years of strong growth in the energy sector. Telecommunications and support services, part of the digital-enabling infrastructure domain, were the largest contributors to the digital economy in Canada. 2010-2017.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">However, much of the Digital Services work in the GC is driven by improving the interoperability of the GC IT systems. Interoperable platforms are the backbone of data and information sharing, big data analytics, and collaboration. The interoperability of technologies, data, and applications across different GC agencies, tiers, and jurisdictions has been a key marker toward Digital Government.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">The business value impact of Digital Services are: Improved Customer Satisfaction and Relationship; Consolidation and Improvement of Services; and Reduced Organizational Costs.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">Some challenges that accompany the transformation from Non-Digital Services to Digital Services include: Complexity and Inflexible Technology, Lack of a Clear Vision for Digital Service and Consumer Journey, Data Management and Data Risk, Privacy Security, Social Disconnect and Organizational Reputation Risk, and Employee Digital Skills, Access to Digital Services.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">The rapid digitalization of the economy is transforming the ways that Canadians buy, consume, and sell goods and services. Today, it is no longer a question of whether a Service Provider should go digital or not; the question is where and how to start. Service drives value, and for organizations to succeed in a digitized world, Digital Services must do more than maintain the status quo.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">A serious consideration should be taken by SSC toward establishing a realistic, unambiguous, and forward-looking position on the development and delivery of Digital Services that takes into account the needs of the business consumers while revisiting and revising  vendor software and service vendor agreements to assess their digital levels. The mantra which should be adopted is Build Digital Services, Not Websites.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">The top Digital Transformation elements often cited are: Customer Experience; Operational Agility; Culture and Leadership; Workforce Enablement; and Digital Technology Integration.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">Success factors in customer experience for the Digital Transformation process, including: Design and Digitize Customer Journeys; Increase Speed and Agility in Insights; Achieve Customer Adoption of Digital Customer Journeys; and Develop Agility in Delivering Journey Transformations.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">Lastly, the TUO is a cornerstone in terms of developing GC-wide Digital Services. As such, there are possible implications related to the Privacy Act for TUO in Canada. SSC should consider assessing its different privacy requirements and restrictions regarding its Digital Services that could affect service delivery.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">However, much of the Digital Services work in the GC is driven by improving the interoperability of the GC IT systems. Interoperable platforms are the backbone of data and information sharing, big data analytics, and collaboration. The interoperability of technologies, data, and applications across different GC agencies, tiers, and jurisdictions has been a key marker toward Digital Government. The aim of Digital Government, or any such program, is to achieve seamless integration between processes and applications, to make the structure of government invisible (or irrelevant) to service delivery, and to set the basis for agile, and truly transformational government.</p>

  <h2>Implications for Government Agencies</h2>

  <h3>Shared Services Canada (SSC)</h3>

  <h4>Value Proposition</h4>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">Making the transition to Digital Services by replacing the reliance on traditional service foundations, such as paper forms, and improving the overall user experience has benefits to both organizations/agencies as well as customers/end users.</p>

  <p>The business value impact of Digital Services is: Improved Customer Satisfaction and Relationship; Consolidation and Improvement of Services; and Reduced Organizational Costs.</p>

  <p><b>Improved Customer Satisfaction and Relationship</b></p>

  <p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">Increased digital service delivery could benefit customers by offering greater convenience in access to services, saving them both time and money.</p><p class="inline"> A Digital Service provides greater speed and greater confidence to the consumer and often leads to improved, rapid, and responsive customer services.</p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content"> An electronic resource is lot quicker to browse or search, to extract information from, and to integrate that information into other material and to cross-search or reference among the different publications.<ref>O’Brien, Clodagh. (2019). <i>[https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/en-ca/blog/13-03-18-what-are-the-benefits-of-digital-transformation What are the Benefits of Digital Transformation? Digital Marketing Institute SM. 2019]</i>. Retrieved 26-May-2019.</ref> Digital Services can contain vast amounts of information for the consumer, with mixed media i.e. images, video, audio animation which could not be replaced in print; all of which is highly mobile and accessible wherever internet access can be obtained.</p><p class="inline"> Additionally, Digital Services provide agency for the consumer in allowing the user to approach services and publications in a way that they can explore and analyze its contents in new ways by a click of the mouse.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">Another aspect of Digital Services, improving customer satisfaction, and forming good relationships with an organization is to take into account the increasing preference individuals have for engaging with Digital Services. The experience of customers is at the heart of digital. As a result, the primary focus of digital transformation is to use cutting-edge technology to improve the customer experience.</p>

  <p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">When consumers interact with a Digital Service, the Service Provider has better access to a multitude of data driven insights from the relationship with the consumer. This highly tangible relationship can be leveraged to improve customer experience and satisfaction.</p><p class="inline"> One of the great benefits of going digital is the ability to track metrics and analyze the data that is gained during digital marketing efforts.</p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content"> More to the point, using these insights allows businesses to optimize their strategies and processes for even better results.<ref>O’Brien, Clodagh.

With Digital Services, organizations can better understand customers and feed that insight into a business strategy that enables customer hyper-personalization, relevancy, and real-time feedback.</p>

  <p class="inline-spacer"></p>

  <p class="inline">Lastly, Digital Services improves an organization’s image or how it is perceived by consumers.</p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content"> Pursuing Digital Services generally has the effect of fostering organizational digital culture. Most issues and complaints against any organization, including governments, is that they are not providing services in a modern way, regardless of their overall service delivery effectiveness. How the external image appears is what matters most to consumers and other organizations doing business with an organization. Transforming services to Digital Services helps this image problem. Additionally, the seemless integration of Digital Services provided from different GC Departments to a single point of interaction (from the customer perspective) is also key. Although some services may not even change their back-end office processes, if the part of the service that is client facing is digital, customer satisfaction will be improved.</p>

  <p><b>Consolidation and Improvement of Services</b></p>

  <p class="inline">By going digital, companies can bring more than just their workforce together, but also their entire architecture. This includes business processes, social media, analytics, and project management interfaces. This consolidation of the company processes and operations enables the business to connect with their target audience and satisfy their needs.</p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content"> A company providing services on the Internet can easily be managed, development  and the improvement of the service depending on the customers´ requirements.

Retrieved 25-May-2019.</ref> Digital Services can enhance operations because electronic interactions offer greater control over resource management through automatization of processes and handling of information.</p>

  <p class="inline-spacer"></p>

  <p class="inline">Digitizing Services pulls processes together through consolidation of business requirements which helps drive standardization of the business tools and process.</p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content"> Digital Services offer multi-access networked products. A networked product can provide multiple points of access to multiple simultaneous users. Offering multi-access also spurs the organization into innovative and agile ways for offering new types of services to the consumer. In business, agility is the ability to continuously improve and develop quickly, especially regarding digital processes.<ref>O’Brien, Clodagh. (2019). <i>[https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/en-ca/blog/13-03-18-what-are-the-benefits-of-digital-transformation What are the Benefits of Digital Transformation? Digital Marketing Institute SM. 2019]</i>. Retrieved 26-May-2019.</ref> When companies implement digital transformation in their business, they are able to include improvements in their processes, thus promoting innovation. They also have greater scope to innovate their products and services because the inclusion of new technologies allows them to include significant improvements in their offerings.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">Digitizing Services also forces an organization’s workforce to update their skillsets and knowledge concerning digital environments and digital workplace. As new technology continues to permeate organizations, the demand for these specialized skills will grow. To name a few skills that are coming into their own, the future of digital business is looking to be heavily built upon the following skillsets: Artificial intelligence, Augmented Reality, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and  Data Exploration/Analytics.<ref>Stephan, Fadi.

  <p class="inline">Consolidating services by digitization helps to reduce the service time to market, improves efficiency with regards to managing resources, and increases transparency with auditability trails.</p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content"> Entering data manually, lack of inter-departmental communication, and delayed processes limits final production. These aspects are conditional for efficiency and can be eliminated with the use of appropriate digital technologies. Replacing manual processes with automated workflows ensures complete control over business activities. Analyzing business data in real time will eliminate delays in the reports and productivity will be greater.</p>

  <p><b>Reduced Organizational Costs</b></p>

  <p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">The main concern of managers is always to find ways to reduce business costs.</p><p class="inline"> Digital transformation, particularly the use of cloud services, enables companies to significantly reduce their operating costs.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">Digital Services often enables one-stop, comprehensive online services for citizens and businesses by linking the diverse services that are offered by different agencies. Furthermore, increasing the ease at which information is shared among individual agencies (up to the point allowed by law) makes for better and/or new services. For instance, the administration of justice would be faster and more cost-effective if the information systems of various agencies under the criminal justice system (police, public prosecutors, public attorneys, courts, prisons) were capable and able to share data.<ref>Lallana, Emmanuel. (2008). <i>e-Government Interoperability. United Nations Development Programme</i>. United Nations. ISBN: 978-974-13-3227-4. Bangkok, Thailand. regionalcentrebangkok@undp.org</ref></p>

  <p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">Using Digital Services allows an organization to reduce or even eliminate local IT infrastructure, decrease the volume of manual administrative costs, and save physical space with regard to paper and asset storage. Digital Services can also provide cost savings by streamlining service. As an example, the </p><p class="inline">TUO (Tell Us Once) principle, can help to reduce administrative burdens, in particular for Public Agencies.</p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content"> The exchange of information that has already been collected is cheaper and less burdensome than collecting and storing it repeatedly. Furthermore, some experts believe that data protection concerns can be better taken into account due to managing less data.</p><p class="inline"> Process optimization and potentially higher administrative efficiency are described as main advantages of TUO for public administrations.</p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content"> These include fewer calls to customer service centers, fewer paper-based applications, faster processing of administrative processes, time savings due to reduced data capture requirements and fewer data errors due to data reuse. This could save costs for public administrations and improve the quality of various public services. Cross-border implementation of the TUO principle could also help to ensure equal treatment for domestic and foreign persons and companies in the use of public services, for which they are obliged to provide information to public authorities. Lastly, TUO can help the GC to focus more on core mandates as staff become less occupied with administrative burdens.</p>

  <h4>Challenges</h4>

  <p>Although Digital Services provide great benefits for organizations there are some challenges that accompany the transformation from Non-Digital Services to Digital Services.</p>

  <p><b>Complexity and Inflexible Technology</b></p>

  <p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">Moving from a Non-Digital Service to a Digital Service and onward to an Optimized Digital Service is no small task. This is further complicated in the public agency sphere where agency cooperation may require legislative changes before sharing information. </p><p class="inline">This is the major challenge for developing Digital Services, the transformation to new processes. Transformation is mostly a grinding iterative process, and part of the iteration process involves the need to tactically and operationally adjust workflows, business rules, content presentations, and (potentially) leverage data in different ways than were originally envisioned when the IT systems were first built. Non-Digital Services and legacy IT systems will need to be assessed for further digitization and organizations trying to build flexible and elegant digital experiences on top of out-dated technology stacks may encounter significant interoperability issues. Lastly, managing a new Digital Service can be a shocking and challenging initiative for an organization who is not mature in that particular business area.</p>

  <p><b>Lack of a Clear Vision for Digital Service and Consumer Journey</b></p>

  <p class="inline">A challenge for organizations is the lack of a clear vision and execution for their Digital Services.</p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content"> A clear vision of how an organization will place the consumer at the center of the service, how to meet the consumer’s digital needs and expectations, assessing data requirements, data storage, network requirements and setting objectives against that vision is often lacking in maturity.</p><p class="inline"> Organizations will often require multiple years in order to figure out their Digital Service Strategy and this longer term mindset is often a challenge for multi-scaled organizations.</p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content"> Service is now a touchstone of end-user experience and staff satisfaction alike, a critical metric that can’t be ignored in favor of pure server performance or delicate data analytics.<ref>Column Technologies.

  <p class="inline-spacer"></p>

  <p class="inline">A lack of or ineffective gathering and leveraging of consumer data can be a major cause of failure in deploying and enhancing a Digital Service. </p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">The root of digital success is consumer data. The challenge many organizations have today is the myriad of siloed systems containing various scraps of data about consumer interactions, with no clear way to pull them together. Improving interoperability for data sharing and analyzing in an efficient way can be very challenging.<ref>Tiersky, Howard.

  <p><b>Data Management and Data Risk</b></p>

  <p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">A Digital Service produces a massive amount of data, upwards of millions of transactions per second, and this influx of data can be very difficult and challenging to manage. High performance processing capacity is needed, which is expensive to purchase and maintain, and proper storage is required. </p><p class="inline">Digital Services only provide convenient access to relevant, reliable, comprehensive, and timely information to consumers if the data in which the services are founded is managed appropriately. </p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">Managing the data of Digital Services is also about the maintenance of IT assets such as the network, data centers, and servers. For example, if a server goes offline for even a few seconds, transactions get interrupted and business is lost. A power failure may cause catastrophic problems for ensuring a service is online and performing. Although organizations invest in dual systems with backups, this means higher costs for the platform.<ref>Palmgren, Juha. (October 21st, 2014). <i>[https://modernbuyerbehaviour.wordpress.com/2014/10/21/benefits-and-disadvantages-of-the-e-services/ Benefits and Disadvantages of the E-Services. Modern Buyer Behaviour]</i>. Retrieved 25-May-2019.</ref></p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">Additionally, many digital or IT resources have an unreliable life span. Paper has a much longer life span than most digital forms of storage. Due to the rapid development of new computer systems it is difficult to judge whether the software or hardware housing and leveraging the data will become outdated or not. As new hardware is developed, structures must be put into place to allow for the migration of existing materials to the new platforms so that they can still be accessed. Methods of preserving data and electronic documents must also be developed. A high degree of reliability of the equipment must be a part of enterprise data management for services that replace printed books.<ref>Ashikuzzaman, Md.

  <p><b>Privacy Security</b></p>

  <p class="inline">When sensitive consumer information and other user data is kept on a database, there always exists a risk that personal information such as addresses, credit card details, email addresses, passwords etc. can be hacked. Protecting the privacy of consumers, is not only a challenge but one of the most important for any organization. Initiatives such as the introduction of a TUO program, requires a sound and consistent legal basis while protecting user information. </p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">There are significant legal challenges regarding the approvals required to allow organizations to exchange and use data pertaining to specific persons and businesses as an alternative to resubmission of the same or equivalent data while protecting the rights of data subjects.</p>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">Many countries have some form or another of a Privacy Act<ref>Justice Canada. (January 8, 2019). <i>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/page-2.html#docCont Privacy Act. Government of Canada]</i>. Retrieved 10-Jan-2019.</ref>, which could be a challenge for Public Agencies as these laws limit information to be collected only for the expressed purpose it was intended unless an exemption is explicitly expressed. Although some flexibility exists, Public Agencies may have more challenges in this area. While there is some degree of flexibility with exchanging citizen’s personal information between Public Agencies, this is the exception rather than the norm. Implementing such programs as a TUO approach may be challenging for services requiring cross-governmental input without serious considerations for the legislative changes necessary.</p>

  <p><b>Social Disconnect and Organizational Reputation Risk</b></p>

  <p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">Digital Services are digital, meaning they are delivered via an online channel. Although there is an increasing tendency for individuals to socialize and communicate in the digital environment rather than through real life contact, this can lead to a sense of disconnect and isolation. This disconnect and isolation can occur between the consumer and the organization delivering the Digital Service. For Public Agencies, this can be a hinderance to organizational reputation. </p><p class="inline">Although consumers expect services to be delivered digitally, they still want a human experience with the organizations that they do business with.</p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content"> This can be very challenging for organizations looking to appear modern while saving money by cutting or re-distributing client-facing staff.<ref>Goodman, Paul.

  <p>Additionally, Digital Services can lead to a sense of hyper-surveillance of the consumer. This is felt more in the Public Agency context where a government begins to develop and become more sophisticated, the citizens will be forced to interact digitally with the government on a larger scale. This interaction could potentially lead to a lack of privacy for civilians as their government obtains more and more information on them.</p>

  <p><b>Employee Digital Skills</b></p>

  <p class="inline">Some employees may have large difficulties in increasing their digital literacy. </p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">While training can help them in this endeavour it still remains difficult for the organization to define what skills are most needed for digital transformation. Long-term, organizations must forecast farther in order to foster a digital culture that encourages continuous learning while planning for future talent requirements.</p>

  <p><b>Access to Digital Services</b></p>

  <p class="inline">There is the event that switching from more traditional manual services to Digital Services may result in some consumers having a decreased opportunity in access to services. </p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">For example, a service that provides web based access and support often does not offer the potential to reach many users including those who live in the remote areas, have low literacy levels and exist on poverty line incomes.<ref>E-Spin.

  <h4>Considerations</h4>

  <p class="inline">The rapid digitalization of the economy is transforming the ways that Canadians buy, consume, and sell goods and services. </p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">Today, it is no longer a question of whether a Service Provider should go digital or not; the question is where and how to start. Service drives value, and for organizations to succeed in a digitized world, Digital Services must do more than maintain the status quo. Service is more than the digital technology that is implemented and more than contracted partnerships for reliable outcomes.</p>

  <p>A serious consideration should be taken by SSC toward establishing a realistic, unambiguous, and forward-looking position on the development and delivery of Digital Services that takes into account the needs of the business consumers while revisiting and revising  vendor software and service vendor agreements to assess their digital levels.</p>

  <p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">Although Digital Transformation varies widely based on organization's specific challenges and demands, there are common themes among existing case studies and published frameworks that all business and technology leaders should consider as they embark on Digital Transformation. </p><p class="inline">The top Digital Transformation elements often cited are: Customer Experience; Operational Agility; Culture and Leadership; Workforce Enablement; and Digital Technology Integration.<ref>Enterprisers Project.

Retrieved 22-May-2019.</ref> Any new service, or existing services being reviewed or modified, must be designed to enable delivery of all suitable components of the service over digital channels, unless there is an approved documented business reason not to do so.<ref>Government of Western Australia.

  <p>SSC should be cognisant of the success factors in customer experience for the Digital Transformation process, including: Design and Digitize Customer Journeys; Increase Speed and Agility in Insights; Achieve Customer Adoption of Digital Customer Journeys; and Develop Agility in Delivering Journey Transformations. Many companies recognize this, with 92% of leaders developing mature digital transformation strategies, specifically to enhance the consumer experience.<ref>O’Brien, Clodagh.

  <p class="inline">SSC should consider keeping user needs as the centerpiece for Digital Services and build the service that meets those needs. </p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">As per the TBS Policy on Service, “Services are designed and delivered considering client needs and feedback, and are progressively e-enabled”.<ref>Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. (October 1st, 2014). <i>[https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27916 Policy on Service. Government of Canada. Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. ISBN: 978-0-660-09949-1]</i>. Retrieved 26-May-2019.</ref></p><p class="inline">The mantra which should be adopted is “Build Digital Services, Not Websites”.<ref>Government of Western Australia. (September 4th, 2017). <i>[https://www.wa.gov.au/government/publications/digital-service-design-principles Digital Service Design Principles. Government of Western Australia. Department of the Premier and Cabinet. Office of Digital Government]</i>. Retrieved 26-May-2019.</ref></p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">Although a lot of Digital Services will be channelled through web pages on the internet the mentality should be to produce services that are focussed on fulfilling the needs of the consumer, not dumping information onto a website and expecting consumers to figure it out on their own. The digital world, and Digital Services, has to connect to the real world, all aspects of a service need to be considered, and make sure the Digital Service actually adds up to something that meets consumer needs. The GC’s Digital Standards can help provide a foundation of the government’s shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused. They are living standards and they will continue to evolve over time.<ref>Government of Canada.

  <p>Some service design and delivery considerations for SSC as a Service Provider to the GC include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Assessment of Legislative and Regulatory Regimes;</li>
    <li>Legacy Information Systems;</li>
    <li>Digital Transformation Prioritization;</li>
    <li>Budgetary Constraints and Resource Allocation;</li>
    <li>Public-Private Provisions;</li>
    <li>Cross-Agency and Cross-Jurisdictional Linkages;</li>
    <li>Delivery of Services through Existing and New Access Channels; and</li>
    <li>Effectiveness and Efficiency.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="expand mw-collapsible-content">SSC, being the cloud broker for the GC, must have sufficient knowledge and understanding on its introduction, implementation, and integration with legacy systems. Cloud is becoming one of the major channels for consumers to access Digital Services, it is imperative that SSC staff and management understand its functionality and how to take advantage of digital opportunities in the cloud environment. This will require having the right staff with the right information in order to succeed. SSC should seriously consider the long term requirements for digital talent including addressing barriers to acquiring top talent such as language and requests for flexible work arrangements.</p>

  <p>SSC should continue its participation in the GC Interoperability Working Group. SSC should continue its co-chairing (with TBS) of the GC Enterprise Architecture Review Board, which will govern the usage of data and align IT infrastructure initiatives among departments.</p>

  <p class="inline">SSC should consider evaluating current offerings in the Service Catalogue for how digital these services are and what steps can be taken in order to progress to an Optimized Digital Service state. The evaluation would be to assess processes and business lines in order to improve efficiencies, reduce costs, and reduce administrative burdens of existing services as well as how a new services could be delivered in a more optimized digital way. </p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">Any new procurements of devices or platforms should have high market value and can be on-boarded easily onto the GC network. However, SSC should be cognisant of not flooding their ability to conduct business with massive amounts of data without properly planning for its collection, storage and analysis.</p>

  <p class="inline-spacer"></p>

  <p class="inline">SSC should also understand that there is a danger that the speed of digital migration outstrips the implementation of legal, regulatory and information security controls that must be part of any on-line business project. </p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">Information and privacy security should be involved at the start of Digital Service projects and is able to clearly articulate the value and risks involved in changing core operational business models.<ref>Bridewell Consulting. (April 16th, 2014). <i>[https://www.bridewellconsulting.com/the-estimated-size-of-the-digital-economy The Estimated Size of the Digital Economy. Bridewell Consulting. (2019). bc@bridewellconsulting.com. Soane Point, 6-8 Market Place, Reading Berkshire, RG1 2EG]</i>. Retrieved 26-May-2019.</ref></p>

  <p class="inline">Lastly, the TUO is a cornerstone in terms of developing GC-wide Digital Services. As such, there are possible implications  related to the Privacy Act for TUO in Canada. SSC should consider assessing  its different privacy requirements and restrictions regarding its Digital Services that could impact service delivery, including data sharing privacy restrictions which may exist across services. </p><p class="expand inline mw-collapsible-content">A running privacy assessment of SSC services would be a valuable tool for SSC to refer to in cases where services are being digitized or other Digital Services are being on-boarded.</p>
